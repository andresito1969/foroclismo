        Architecture:
            Service container -> Used to configure all app, we can for example bind the instance of an interface and use the interface.
            Service providers -> Used to register classes so we can inject them, we can bind them (factory) or singleton them.
            Facades -> Static methods
            Repository pattern -> Methods that our controllers will use to interact with the Model.
